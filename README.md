# Crash-Detection-UB-Hacking-2021
Detecting if a car is going to crash and warning the driver. Built for UB Hacking 2021. If a car is moving and there is something (human, car, animal, etc) within a dangerous distance, the system will warn the driver. 

## Purpose
- I was walking across a crosswalk and the car didn't stop. I had to dodge. 
- This system will provide a prototype to prevent drivers from hitting people or objects. Distracted driving is unfortunately a reality and this system will be able to get their attention so they can act accordingly.

## Ideas for Improvement
The current system is only used for monitoring the front of the car. However, changing lanes can also be dangerous. Sensors and motors can be added on each side of the vehicle to detect horizontal speed and distance from other objects and warn the driver in a similar manner.
